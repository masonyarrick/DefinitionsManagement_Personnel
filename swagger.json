    "description" : "The DM Personnel (Definition) API uses defined messages to query (get) create (post), update (put) or delete individual versions of personnel  objects which are Personnel Class, Person, and Test Specification. The Post/object messages are used to create a definition of a specific object type. The Put/object messages are used to update a definition of a specific object type. Delete/object messages used to delete a definition of a specific object type. The DM Personnel (Definitions) API provides Developers the Get/object messages to query for definition versions of a specific object type.  The DM function services production and support operations by managing all Level 3 and some Level 2 information definition. The primary work definition object is the work master which is the requirements for a work task in a scheduled job order.  The work master contains the required resourse specifications (bill of materials and required resources), the workflow specification for execution, and parameter specifications. The work master includes    1) Material specification object with material use for production operations as material produced, consumable, material consumed, by-product produced, co-product produced, and yield produced. The material specification is typically represents the manufacturing bill of materials (BoM).    2) Required equipment specifications and personnel specifications. The resource specifications define the applied resource definition or class objects.    3) Workflow specification object defines a workflow as a collection of nodes and connections with the rules for relationship and dependency. A node may reference a chilld work master for more detail. The workflow specification can reference a master recipe (ANSI/ISA-88.00.01 and IEC 61512-1 definitions), standard operating procedure (SOP), standard operating conditions (SOC), routing, or assembly steps based on the production strategy used.      4) parameter specification object defines the job order specific parameters and rule sets which instructs how L3 manufacturing operations and L2 process sequences how to execute production or supporting operations.     Each work master (ISA-95 Part 4) defines its scope as an equipment heirachy level as either general, site, work cell, unit or lower.",
